# Weather Data Analysis Project

This project involves an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive weather dataset spanning 2012, featuring hourly records of temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions. Utilizing Python's pandas library, the project performs various data exploration techniques such as identifying unique values, handling null entries, and generating descriptive statistics. Furthermore, visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn illustrate temperature trends, distribution, and weather condition counts, revealing significant seasonal patterns and insights into weather variability. This analysis serves as a foundational step for understanding climate trends and impacts.
